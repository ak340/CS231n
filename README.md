# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This repository contains my assignment solutions of the [course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from Stanford. 
There are three assignments:
1) [Assignment 1](/assignment1):
Implementations of k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine and SoftMax loss functions, and two-layer network.
2) [Assignment 2](/assignment2):
Hands-on implementations of Fully-Connected Layers and Convolutional Networks as well as regularization techniques: Batch Normalization and Dropout.
3) [Assignment 3](/assignment3):
Final assignment on advanced techniques in Deep Learning: RNN, LSTM, GAN and etc.

Many thanks to CS231N teaching group for their effort and time for this excellent course.
